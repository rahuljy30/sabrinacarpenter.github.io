        <h1>Taste</h1>

        <pre>
Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too

Uh-huh, he pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
He's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guess who he learned that from

Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation

I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there

You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share

Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do (I bet you do)
Just know you'll taste me too (taste me too, oh)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you (you, no)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la) yeah, ah-ah
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
        </pre>
