        <h1>Couldn't Make It Any Harder</h1>

        <pre>
Oh, what I'd give to be
Meeting you as the glass-half-full version of me
I was easier than I am now
Would've folded, but I can't now
Heard they say this emotion should be kind

But I couldn't make it
Any harder to love me
Your arms are reaching
And your eager heart is throbbin'
I know you're frustrated
'Cause I will not let you touch me
You say you can take it
But you don't know how hard I can make it

F*ckboys you'll never meet
Well, you can thank them for a while
So goddamn reactionary
And for the graveyard in my stomach
Filled with pivotal formative comments
Meanwhile, you're just tryna tell me I look nice (ooh)

But I couldn't make it
Any harder to love me
Your arms are reachin'
And your eager heart is throbbin'
I know you're frustrated
'Cause I will not let you touch me
You say you can take it
But you don't know how hard I can make it

Oh no
Oh, oh, oh

I couldn't make it
Any harder to love me
Oh, one day, believe me
You'll want someone that makes it easy


 </pre>
