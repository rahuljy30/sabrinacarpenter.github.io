        <h1>Bed Chem</h1>

        <pre>
I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me going like, ooh

Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like (Ooh)
Maybe it's all in my head

But I bet we'd have really good bed chem

How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round, oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doing bad things, that's bed chem
How you're looking at me, yeah, I know what that means, and I'm obsessed
Are you free next week? I'd bet we'd have really good

Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my time zone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy (Ooh)

Who's the cute guy with the wide, blue eyes and the big, bad mmm? Like (Ooh)
I know I sound a bit redundant

But I bet we'd have really good bed chem

How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round, oh, it just makes sense (Makes sense)
How you talk so sweet when you're doing bad things, that's bed chem (That's bed chem)
How you're looking at me, yeah, I know what that means, and I'm obsessed (So obsessed)
Are you free next week? I'd bet we'd have really good bed chem
And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time (Bed chem)

And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine (Bed, bed chem, chem)
And I bet it's even better than in my head
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round, oh, it just makes sense (Oh, it just makes sense)
How you talk so sweet when you're doing bad things, that's bed chem (That's bed chem)
How you're looking at me, yeah, I know what that means, and I'm obsessed (So obsessed)
Are you free next week? I'd bet we'd have really good
Oh, baby
