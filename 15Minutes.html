        <h1>15 Minutes</h1>

        <pre>
The clock is tickin' lately
Guess that means I'm doin' something right
Been here a long time, baby
But gosh, I hope I make it through the night

It's fleetin' like my battery life
Hard to hold on to like every guy
When you're hot, it's just a matter of time

But I can do a lot with fifteen minutes
Lot of pretty boys, lot of funny business
Take a couple bucks, turn 'em into millions
You, you, you know I
I can do a lot with fifteen minutes
Only gonna take two to make you finish
Piss some people off, show 'em what they're missin'
You, you, you know I can

Where did all these parties come from?
Whеn did all you bitches get so nice?
Runnin' out of thе woodwork
And hopin' there's no brain between my eyes (My, my)

Well, it's fleetin' like we're all gonna die (All gonna die)
Hard to hold like conversations when high (Conversations when high)
When you're hot, they're gonna eat you alive (Alive, alive, alive)

But I can do a lot with fifteen minutes (I can)
Lot of pretty boys, lot of funny business (Tell me I'm wrong)
Take a couple bucks, turn 'em into millions
You, you, you know I
I can do a lot with fifteen minutes (Sure can)
Only gonna take two to make you finish (No)
Piss some people off, show 'em what they're missin' (Ooh, you)
You, you, you know I can

I
You know I
You know I

When my time's up, baby (Na-na-na)
I'll leak some pictures maybe
Say somethin' batshit crazy
I'll do it, don't you make me
When my time's up, baby (Time's up, baby)
I'll leak some pictures maybe
Say somethin' batshit crazy
I'll do it, don't you make me, yeah, oh (Ah)

Uh-uh, uh, uh
Uh, I'll do it
Oh, I'll do it
Oh, I'll do it, babe
