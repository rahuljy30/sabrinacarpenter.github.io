        <h1>Don't Smile</h1>

        <pre>
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her

My heart is heavy now, it's like a hundred pounds
It's falling faster than the way you love to shut me down
I think I need a shower, my friends are taking shots
You think it's happy hour, for me it's not

Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me

Pour my feelings in the microphone
I stay in, and when the girls come home
I want one of them to take my phone
Take my phone and lose your
Number, I don't wanna be tempted
Pick up when you wanna fall back in
You can fake it, but you know I know
Know I know

Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
Don't smile because it happened, baby, cry because it's over
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me
Oh, you're supposed to think about me every time you hold her
I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me
        </pre>
