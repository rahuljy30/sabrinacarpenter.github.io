        <h1>Lie to Girls</h1>

        <pre>
Don't swear on your mom
That it's the first drink that you've had in like a month
No, don't say it was just
An isolated incident that happened once
There's no need to pretend
I've never seen an ugly truth that I can't bend
To something that looks better
I'm stupid, but I'm clever
Yeah, I can make a shitshow look a whole lot like forever and ever

You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Don't I know it better than anyone else?

All of your best excuses
No, they don't stand a chance
Against all the chances I give you
Isn't ideal, but damn
You don't even have to try
Turn you into a good guy
You don't have to lift a finger
It's lucky for you I'm just like
My mother (And my sisters)
All my (All my friends)
The girl outside the strip club getting her tarot cards read
We love to read the cold, hard facts and swear they're incorrect
We love to mistake butterflies for cardiac arrest

You don't have to lie to girls
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Like you, they'll just lie to themselves
You don't have to lie to girls (Don't have)
If they like you, they'll just lie to themselves
Don't I know it better than anyone else?

Girls will cry and girls will lie and
Girls will do it 'til they die for you
They'll cry and girls will lie and
Do it 'til the day they die for you (Ooh)
Girls will cry and girls will lie and (Ooh)
Girls will lose their goddamn minds for you (Oh)
They'll cry and girls will lie and
Do it 'til the day they die for you
