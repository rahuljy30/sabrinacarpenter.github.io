        <h1>Please Please Please (feat. Dolly Parton)</h1>

        <pre>
[Dolly Parton]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Mm

[Sabrina Carpenter & Dolly Parton]
I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby

Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me like the others, uh
Please, please, please (Ah)

[Dolly Parton & Sabrina Carpenter]
I have a fun idea, babe, maybe just stay inside
I know you're craving some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice (It's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (Kinda), really (Really), really

[Sabrina Carpenter & Dolly Parton]
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right (Don't prove I'm right)
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me like the others, uh
Please, please, please (Ah)

If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please
Please, please, please
Please (Please), please (Please), please (Please)
Don't do it, mm
