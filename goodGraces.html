        <h1>Good Graces</h1>

        <pre>
(I won't give a f*ck about you)
Oh, mm
(I won't give a f*ck about you)
Mm

When I love you, I'm sweet like an angel
Drawin' hearts 'round our names
And dreamin' of writing vows, rockin' cradles
Don't mistake my nice for naive
I don't waste a second, I know lots of guys
You do somethin' suspect, this cute ass bye-bye
Like, ooh

Baby, you say you really like it being mine?
So let me give you some advice

Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred

Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that (Like that) so fast (So fast)
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred

I won't give a f*ck about you
I won't give a f*ck about you
I won't give a f*ck about you
That was cool
I won't give a f*ck about you (Oh)
I won't give a f*ck about you
I won't give a f*ck about you
Yeah

I'll tell the world you finish your chores prematurely
Break my heart and I swear I'm movin' on
With your favorite athlete
Shoot his shot every night
Want you every second, don't need other guys
You do somethin' sus, kiss my cute ass bye

Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin' (Amazin')
At turnin' lovin' into hatred

Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that (Like that) so fast (So fast)
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred

I won't give a f*ck about you
I won't give a f*ck about you
I won't give a f*ck about you
Oh, no

I won't give a f*ck about you (Oh)
I won't give a f*ck about you
I won't give a f*ck about you
Oh

No, I won't
I won't give a f*ck about you, no, I won't
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
No, I won't
I won't give a f*ck about you, no, I won't
(I won't, I won't, I won't)
     </pre>
